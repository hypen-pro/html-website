<p><font size="5">A <b>computer virus</b> is a type of computer program that,when executed,replicates by modifing other computer programs and inserting its own code.if this replication succeeds,the infected areas are said to be "infected" with an computer virus,a metaphor derived from biological viruses.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Computer viruses generlly require a host program.The virus writes its own code into the host program.When the program runs,the written virus program is executed first,causing infection and damage.A computer worm does not need a host program,as it is an independent program or code chunk. Therefore, it is not restricted by the host program, but can run independently and actively carry out attacks.</font></p> 

<p><font size="5">Virus writers use social engineering deceptions and exploit detailed knowledge of security vulnerabilities to initially infect systems and to spread the virus. Viruses use complex anti-detection/stealth strategies to evade antivirus software.Motives for creating viruses can include seeking profit (e.g., with ransomware), desire to send a political message, personal amusement, to demonstrate that a vulnerability exists in software, for sabotage and denial of service, or simply because they wish to explore cybersecurity issues, artificial life and evolutionary algorithms.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Computer viruses cause billions of dollars' worth of economic damage each year.

In response, an industry of antivirus software has cropped up, selling or freely distributing virus protection to users of various operating systems.</font></p>

<p><font size="13"><h1 style="text-align:center;">History</h1></font></p>
<p><font size="5">The first academic work on the theory of self-replicating computer programs was done in 1949 by John von Neumann who gave lectures at the University of Illinois about the "Theory and Organization of Complicated Automata". The work of von Neumann was later published as the "Theory of self-reproducing automata". In his essay von Neumann described how a computer program could be designed to reproduce itself.Von Neumann's design for a self-reproducing computer program is considered the world's first computer virus, and he is considered to be the theoretical "father" of computer virology.In 1972, Veith Risak directly building on von Neumann's work on self-replication, published his article "Selbstreproduzierende Automaten mit minimaler Informationsübertragung" (Self-reproducing automata with minimal information exchange).The article describes a fully functional virus written in assembler programming language for a SIEMENS 4004/35 computer system. In 1980 Jürgen Kraus wrote his diplom thesis "Selbstreproduktion bei Programmen" (Self-reproduction of programs) at the University of Dortmund.In his work Kraus postulated that computer programs can behave in a way similar to biological viruses.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">The Creeper virus was first detected on ARPANET, the forerunner of the Internet, in the early 1970s.Creeper was an experimental self-replicating program written by Bob Thomas at BBN Technologies in 1971.Creeper used the ARPANET to infect DEC PDP-10 computers running the TENEX operating system.Creeper gained access via the ARPANET and copied itself to the remote system where the message, "I'M THE CREEPER. CATCH ME IF YOU CAN!" was displayed.The Reaper program was created to delete Creeper.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">In 1982, a program called "Elk Cloner" was the first personal computer virus to appear "in the wild"—that is, outside the single computer or computer lab where it was created.Written in 1981 by Richard Skrenta, a ninth grader at Mount Lebanon High School near Pittsburgh, it attached itself to the Apple DOS 3.3 operating system and spread via floppy disk.On its 50th use the Elk Cloner virus would be activated, infecting the personal computer and displaying a short poem beginning "Elk Cloner: The program with a personality."</font></p>

<p><font size="5">In 1984 Fred Cohen from the University of Southern California wrote his paper "Computer Viruses – Theory and Experiments".It was the first paper to explicitly call a self-reproducing program a "virus", a term introduced by Cohen's mentor Leonard Adleman. In 1987, Fred Cohen published a demonstration that there is no algorithm that can perfectly detect all possible viruses.Fred Cohen's theoretical compression virus was an example of a virus which was not malicious software (malware), but was putatively benevolent (well-intentioned). However, antivirus professionals do not accept the concept of "benevolent viruses", as any desired function can be implemented without involving a virus (automatic compression, for instance, is available under Windows at the choice of the user). Any virus will by definition make unauthorised changes to a computer, which is undesirable even if no damage is done or intended. The first page of Dr Solomon's Virus Encyclopaedia explains the undesirability of viruses, even those that do nothing but reproduce.</font></p>

<p><font size="5">An article that describes "useful virus functionalities" was published by J. B. Gunn under the title "Use of virus functions to provide a virtual APL interpreter under user control" in 1984.The first IBM PC virus in the "wild" was a boot sector virus dubbed (c)Brain,created in 1986 by Amjad Farooq Alvi and Basit Farooq Alvi in Lahore, Pakistan, reportedly to deter unauthorized copying of the software they had written.The first virus to specifically target Microsoft Windows, WinVir was discovered in April 1992, two years after the release of Windows 3.0.The virus did not contain any Windows API calls, instead relying on DOS interrupts. A few years later, in February 1996, Australian hackers from the virus-writing crew VLAD created the Bizatch virus (also known as "Boza" virus), which was the first known virus to target Windows 95. In late 1997 the encrypted, memory-resident stealth virus Win32.Cabanas was released—the first known virus that targeted Windows NT (it was also able to infect Windows 3.0 and Windows 9x hosts).</font></p>

<p><font size="5">Even home computers were affected by viruses. The first one to appear on the Commodore Amiga was a boot sector virus called SCA virus, which was detected in November 1987.</font></p>
